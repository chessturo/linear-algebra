# Solutions to Vector Addition Problems

1. $$ \begin{bmatrix} 8 \\ 4 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} $$
1. We can consider subtraction of real numbers to just be adding $$-1$$ times
the second operand (e.g., $$2 - 3 = 2 + (-1 \times 3)$$).
We'll define vector subtraction the same way, so the solution to the problem
given is:
    
    $$ \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} $$
