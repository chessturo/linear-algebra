# Welcome!
This series of notes was written by an undergraduate student at the University
of Washington, with UW's [MATH 208](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~m208/) in
mind, but the goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for students broadly.
With this in mind, very few prerequesites are presumed; the only expectation is
some exposure to systems of linear equations (at the level of a high school math
course) and comfort with algebra.
Some prior knowledge of the concept of a "vector" might also be helpful, but is
not strictly required to understand what's going on.
